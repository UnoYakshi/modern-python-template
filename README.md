# Modern Python Template (MPT)
A one day start Coockiecutter Python project template with configured up-to-date tools.
It is framework-agnostic as it doesn't come with any framework at all at all [for now].

- [ ] Rye as a package manager
- [ ] code quality tools via pre-commit: ruff, black, MyPy
- [ ] development and production Docker Compose YAMLs and staged Dockerfile
- [ ] convenient file structure with `src/`, , `tests/`, `build/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`
- [ ] set-up semantic-release for automatic deployment, git tagging, etc. via GitHub Actions (use environment variables)
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` with configured and commented scripts, pytest, coverage, black, ruff, etc.
